# Clawvisor

Clawvisor is a gatekeeper service that sits between AI agents and external APIs. Agents never hold credentials. Every request flows through Clawvisor, which checks restrictions, enforces task scopes, routes to human approval when needed, injects credentials from an encrypted vault, and delivers formatted results back to the agent.

## How It Works

```

```

Authorization has three layers:

- **Restrictions** — hard blocks you set on specific service/action pairs. If a restriction matches, the request is blocked immediately.
- **Task scopes** — pre-approved sets of actions the agent declares up front. If the action is in scope with `auto_execute`, it runs without per-request approval. Tasks can be session-scoped (with expiry) or standing (indefinite).
- **Per-request approval** — the default. Anything not covered by a task scope goes to the approval queue and the user is notified via Telegram.

Unmatched requests go to the approval queue, not to a block. The default is approve.

## Supported Services

| Service ID | Service | Actions |
|---|---|---|
| `google.gmail` | Gmail | `list_messages`, `get_message`, `send_message` |
| `google.calendar` | Google Calendar | `list_events`, `get_event`, `create_event`, `update_event`, `delete_event`, `list_calendars` |
| `google.drive` | Google Drive | `list_files`, `get_file`, `create_file`, `update_file`, `search_files` |
| `google.contacts` | Google Contacts | `list_contacts`, `get_contact`, `search_contacts` |
| `github` | GitHub | `list_issues`, `get_issue`, `create_issue`, `comment_issue`, `list_prs`, `get_pr`, `list_repos`, `search_code` |
| `apple.imessage` | iMessage | `search_messages`, `list_threads`, `get_thread`, `send_message` |

Google services share a single OAuth connection — activating one activates all four. GitHub uses a personal access token. iMessage reads the local `chat.db` on macOS and is always available without activation on supported machines.

## Quickstart

**Prerequisites:** Go 1.23+, Node 18+

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ericlevine/clawvisor-gatekeeper.git
cd clawvisor-gatekeeper

# Interactive setup — installs deps, builds, generates config
make setup

# Start the server
make run

# Launch the TUI dashboard (in a separate terminal)
make tui
```

That's it — three commands to a working setup.

`make setup` walks through environment, Google OAuth, iMessage, and intent verification configuration. It generates a `config.yaml` with sensible defaults (hit Enter through most prompts for a basic local setup) and writes `~/.clawvisor/config.yaml` with the server URL so the TUI knows where to connect.

`make run` starts the server. In local mode it auto-creates an `admin@local` user, opens the web dashboard via a magic link, and writes a session file (`~/.clawvisor/.local-session`) for the TUI.

`make tui` launches the terminal dashboard. It automatically authenticates using the local session file — no manual token configuration needed. On first launch it exchanges the session token for a refresh token and saves it for future use.

You can also run without the setup script:

```bash
DATABASE_DRIVER=sqlite JWT_SECRET=dev-secret go run ./cmd/server
```

A `vault.key` file is auto-generated on first run if one doesn't exist. This is the master encryption key for stored credentials.

### Configuration

Clawvisor loads `config.yaml` from the working directory (override with `CONFIG_FILE` env var). Most settings have env var overrides:

| Setting | Env var | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Database driver | `DATABASE_DRIVER` | `postgres` or `sqlite` |
| Postgres URL | `DATABASE_URL` | Required for postgres driver |
| JWT secret | `JWT_SECRET` | **Required** |
| Google OAuth | `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Needed for Google services |
| Public URL | `PUBLIC_URL` | Used in Telegram notification links |
| LLM safety | `CLAWVISOR_LLM_SAFETY_*` | Optional post-execution safety check |

See [`config.example.yaml`](config.example.yaml) for the full configuration reference.

## Agent Integration

### 1. Create an agent token

In the dashboard, create an agent and copy the bearer token. The agent uses this for all API calls.

### 2. Create a task (optional, for multi-step workflows)

```bash
curl -s -X POST "$CLAWVISOR_URL/api/tasks" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AGENT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "purpose": "Triage inbox and draft replies",
    "authorized_actions": [
      {"service": "google.gmail", "action": "list_messages", "auto_execute": true},
      {"service": "google.gmail", "action": "get_message", "auto_execute": true},
      {"service": "google.gmail", "action": "send_message", "auto_execute": false}
    ],
    "expires_in_seconds": 1800
  }'
```

The task starts as `pending_approval`. The user approves it via Telegram or the dashboard. Once active, requests with the `task_id` that match an `auto_execute` action run immediately.

### 3. Make a gateway request

```bash
curl -s -X POST "$CLAWVISOR_URL/api/gateway/request" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AGENT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "service": "google.gmail",
    "action": "list_messages",
    "params": {"max_results": 10, "query": "is:unread"},
    "reason": "Checking for unread messages to triage",
    "request_id": "req-001",
    "task_id": "task-uuid-here",
    "context": {
      "source": "user_message",
      "callback_url": "https://your-agent/callback"
    }
  }'
```

### Response statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `executed` | Action completed. Result in `result.summary` and `result.data`. |
| `pending` | Awaiting human approval. Wait for callback or poll with same `request_id`. |
| `blocked` | A restriction blocks this action. Do not retry. |
| `pending_activation` | Service not connected. Response includes `activate_url`. |
| `pending_task_approval` | Task declared but not yet approved by the user. |
| `error` | Execution failed. Check `error` field for details. |

### Callbacks

When a pending request resolves, Clawvisor POSTs to the `callback_url`:

```json
{
  "request_id": "req-001",
  "status": "executed",
  "result": {"summary": "Found 3 unread messages", "data": [...]},
  "audit_id": "a8f3..."
}
```

## Dashboard

The web UI provides:

- **Approvals** — approve or deny pending requests and task scopes
- **Tasks** — view active/standing tasks, revoke task scopes, see audit trails
- **Services** — activate services via OAuth (Google) or API key (GitHub)
- **Restrictions** — create and manage hard blocks on service/action pairs
- **Audit log** — searchable history of every gateway request with outcomes
- **Agents** — create agent tokens, manage per-agent restrictions
- **Telegram** — pair your Telegram bot for mobile approval notifications

## TUI

The terminal dashboard (`clawvisor tui`) provides the same approval and monitoring capabilities without leaving the terminal.

```bash
# After setup + server are running:
make tui

# Or directly:
clawvisor tui

# With explicit connection details:
clawvisor tui --url http://localhost:8080 --token <refresh_token>
```

Authentication is automatic in local mode. The flow:

1. `clawvisor server` writes `~/.clawvisor/.local-session` with a one-time magic token
2. `clawvisor tui` reads this file, exchanges the token via `POST /api/auth/magic`, and saves the resulting refresh token to `~/.clawvisor/config.yaml`
3. Subsequent launches use the saved refresh token directly

For password-mode servers, the TUI prompts for email and password on first launch.

You can also set credentials via environment variables:

```bash
export CLAWVISOR_URL=http://localhost:8080
export CLAWVISOR_TOKEN=<refresh_token>
clawvisor tui
```

go test ./...                       # run all tests
go vet ./...                        # lint

make run-sqlite                     # run with SQLite

```

## Security Model

- **Agents never receive credentials.** Credentials are injected inside the Clawvisor process after authorization. They are stripped from all responses, logs, and error messages.
- **Vault encryption.** Credentials are encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM using a master keyfile (`vault.key`).
- **Audit trail.** Every gateway request is logged with a unique `request_id` (enforced by DB constraint). Outcomes are updated after execution.
- **Response formatting.** Adapter results are semantically formatted — secrets are stripped, HTML/Unicode is sanitized before anything reaches the agent.
- **Optional LLM safety check.** A configurable post-execution check scans formatted output for prompt injection or unsafe content before delivery.
